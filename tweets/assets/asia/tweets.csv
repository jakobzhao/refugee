CAA is for refugees from 3 Muslim majority countries. NOT for Indians of ANY religion.

"Two concrete steps protesters could ask for:

1) Amend (not repeal) CAA to make it about generally helping persecuted. No religious bias but refugees should also be helped.

2) Ask for a repeal of the 2003 Citizenship Amendment. This is the legal basis for an NRC."
