"Myth Buster: Citizenship Amendment Act 2019

It is only a Constitutional process to give citizenship to those who were denied basic rights for the last 70 years. It aims to target genuine refugees and not intruders. #IndiaSupportsCAApic.twitter.com/CtcksHi5mR"
Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is a step towards ‘inclusion not ‘exclusion’ as falsely propagated by vested interests. It aims at providing citizenship to persecuted refugees and at no cost will affect the rights of any citizen of India. #IndiaSupportsCAApic.twitter.com/EeLELjAwM6

"Few months back, i met Hindu Refugees from Pakistan near Signature bridge, Delhi.

They were suffering for no fault of theirs. They have no place to go except India.

By providing them Indian citizenship, PM @narendramodi JI has given a sense of renewed hope.

"Thanks to @narendramodi ,the Hindu refugees, who fled from oppression, can have a life of dignity n peace. A thing, they thought would be impossible till now. Their only fault for being oppressed, was their religion!  Let's move forward with everyone with us! #IndiaSupportsCAA"

"Recalling my visit to Hindu refugees from Pakistan near  Delhi on my last  birthday. Unfortunately, they weren't aware of Navratri.

Modi is quoting Jaggi Vasudev to justify CAA. But PM doesn’t quote Swamy Vivekanand who said “Iam proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth.” Does Jaggi Vasudev stand as chance before Vivekanand?
"For CENTURIES, INDIA has welcomed visitors and refugees who brought with them their rich culture, languages and traditions. Indians always preached universal love and peace for the universal family. CAA is very much in line with India's ethos of fraternity.

"Citizenship Act 1955 ALREADY allowed for giving citizenship to refugees fleeing persecution.
Only new thing about CAA is, it discriminates between refugees on the basis of religion.

"On The eve of 2020, I’m sad there are fashionable people on dharna in the Delhi cold to prevent refugees from Bangladesh securing Indian citizenship. They hate these unfortunate people who fled their homes & came to India to remain Hindu. Their heart bleeds for Palestine though."
May 2020 give us all  strength to continue to rage against the dying of the light. In every continent. In every country. In every community. In the no man's lands where refugees struggle to exist. Within every soul. Hasta la victoria siempre!

"Sir,
Iraqi asylum seekers and refugees ask you to rescue them from the long waiting of resettlement.
Please, 3 to 6 years of living in fear, is too long..
We lived fear in Iraq and the unstability in the host countries..
It's unbearable.

"Can you find the answer of: why is this huge number of people who see the sea more merciful than living under oppression?
Many Iraqi asylum seekers&refugees went to the sea to get rid of the long waiting for resettlement with no solution.

"Iraqi asylum seekers&refugees had no choice but to leave their homes because of death threat,and..

Americans are going to destroy whole countries then a year later get surprised at the in flux of refugees & have the audacity to say “Go back to where you came from” as if these motherfuckers didn’t bomb it until it was inhabitable lol

India Upfront at 8: More ‘fakery’ on CAA. 107th Report of Committee on Home Affairs presented to RS led by Pranab says grant Indian citizenship to Bangladeshi & Pakistani minority refugees. So why does Cong & Lutyens brand NDA’s CAA anti-Muslim? Tweet with #CAAAntiModiConspiracypic.twitter.com/GG2TXhBYRv
Those who oppose CAA should know there is only one better alternative: creation of minority enclaves in Bangladesh where security is provided by India trained Hindu forces. Then we can send our Hindu refugees back. If those outraging over CAA can get this done we can repeal CAA
