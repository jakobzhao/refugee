Dalit leaders have fallen into the narrative trap of Congress & their misleading supporters. The Dalit leaders should be aware that those Hindu refugees who have fled from Pakistan are mostly Dalit. They are treated as subhumans in Pak from where they fled to our country- Modi pic.twitter.com/mvRpnBDSxk
