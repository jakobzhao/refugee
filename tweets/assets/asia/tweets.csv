Modi is quoting Jaggi Vasudev to justify CAA. But PM doesn‚Äôt quote Swamy Vivekanand who said ‚ÄúIam proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth.‚Äù Does Jaggi Vasudev stand as chance before Vivekanand?
"For CENTURIES, INDIA has welcomed visitors and refugees who brought with them their rich culture, languages and traditions. Indians always preached universal love and peace for the universal family. CAA is very much in line with India's ethos of fraternity.
