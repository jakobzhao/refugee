But, 
Why the Rohingyas want to come to India?
and 
not China? 

Because Unlike India,

India should have a Register of Citizens like all other significant Nations - should be done with least inconvenience though. Also regularising citizenship of persecuted refugees from neighbouring theocratic states who had sought asylum here years back is humane act! Appreciate
"Which one we need urgently? 

1)Detention  centers  for refugees

2) Rehabilitation centers  for  bhakts
