"2. I mean seriously?! She hardly moved her finger in an issue that has rattled the entire nation.

"In 1978-79, Left Front govt under Jyoti Basu massacred Dalit Hindu refugees in an island in Sunderbans. Women raped, children massacred. Their fault: They wanted refuge. They did not want financial help from Bengal govt. They were setting up a village economy. Read @deepscribblepic.twitter.com/D0vg75RMS4"
"The Hindu Dalit refugees thought the Left was their friend. When the Left came to power in 1977, they wanted to nurture their Muslim votebank and saw no political benefits in absorbing Dalit Hindus from Bangladesh..(is secularism all about only appeasement & vote bank politics?)"

Modi is quoting Jaggi Vasudev to justify CAA. But PM doesn’t quote Swamy Vivekanand who said “Iam proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth.” Does Jaggi Vasudev stand as chance before Vivekanand?
"For CENTURIES, INDIA has welcomed visitors and refugees who brought with them their rich culture, languages and traditions. Indians always preached universal love and peace for the universal family. CAA is very much in line with India's ethos of fraternity.
