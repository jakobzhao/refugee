"Asked this last week,am asking again .Why? Why does India need this polarising bill?We already had laws for refugees in place.The Home ministry doesn‚Äôt even know numbers of refugee who will benefit from this.Surely,there are more urgent priorities for India.Why light this fire ?"
Best time for Indian Muslims &JNU students to reach Europe Canada and US ir even Pakistan &Syria by seeking political assylum & begin new brilliant career. Dream come true. No visa problems. UN is also favourable & will happily grant refugee status. India no good for them
"We‚Äôre at the Global #RefugeeForum to ensure the voices of older refugees are heard. They face discrimination and barriers to access the services and support they need. We want humanitarian actors to address these challenges.
