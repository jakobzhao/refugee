"Few months back, i met Hindu Refugees from Pakistan near Signature bridge, Delhi.

They were suffering for no fault of theirs. They have no place to go except India.

By providing them Indian citizenship, PM @narendramodi JI has given a sense of renewed hope.

Modi is quoting Jaggi Vasudev to justify CAA. But PM doesn’t quote Swamy Vivekanand who said “Iam proud to belong to a nation which has sheltered the persecuted and the refugees of all religions and all nations of the earth.” Does Jaggi Vasudev stand as chance before Vivekanand?
"I think there are refugees called  ( IRAQI REFUGEES )& asylum seekers
Who have been waiting of resettlement for long long years, 
Do they considered as humans in humanity concepts or not?
They need urgent response.

"Citizenship Act 1955 ALREADY allowed for giving citizenship to refugees fleeing persecution.
Only new thing about CAA is, it discriminates between refugees on the basis of religion.
