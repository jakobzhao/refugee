Very strong point from Bernie that we don't have decades to solve the climate problem-- we have 8-9 years. Also important that he linked climate refugees (and immigration) to the environmental crisis #dem

Bernie Sanders’ answer on climate change was on . We need to remember that the climate crisis is creating a refugee crisis. His politics is the most intersectional on stage. Bernie’s immigration policy centers human rights and refugees. #DemDebate
"On #ClimateChange, #BernieSanders says that “We don’t have decades” to act. Within 8 or 9 years cities will be under water, with millions of #ClimateChange refugees. We must tell the fossil fuel industry that “their short term products are not worth the cost to our planet.”"
