"Morrison's government won't provide dry communities with water. Won't provide adequate bushfire resources. Sick, disabled & aged care needs are not being met. Newstart recipients are treated like criminals. Refugees are treated worse than criminals. What use is this gov? #auspol"
"Question for @govkristinoem , will you be welcoming refugees into the governor’s mansion? Or are you just thrusting them on rural communities that are powerless to say or do anything about it? If you’re a Republican governor, you’re doing a really good job of hiding it."
".@AndyBeshearKY the Gov of #Kentucky said his state will  continue to welcome #refugees.

Facts:

- #Obama proposed refugees cap was 116K/yr 

- #Trump proposal is to slash that to only 18K/yr in 2020
