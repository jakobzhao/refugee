This story is totally insane. If the Trump administration won’t contest extradition (instead they're goosing it to support false claims on refugee processing) then Iraq should drop the case against a clearly innocent man.  https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/01/27/the-fight-to-save-an-innocent-refugee-from-almost-certain-death …
