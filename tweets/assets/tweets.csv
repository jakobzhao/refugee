"The reaction of the West & #Erdogan to #Assad & #Putin's #genocide:

"We will journey
Like wise men into 
Barns of  
Mead
Bleating to jingles
Of fork and feed

Let’s shift the hay
From our mouth and 
Move our lids
Bovine heavy with wine

How can we chew

When sea-plucked lambs
Cry
Carving arms 
With that sharp
Christmas knife #vss365 #Refugees"

Catch me on @TuckerCarlson tonight at 8pm discussing #Refugees

They carry a weight of cruel irony with the atrocities happening at our border. This won’t go away. #Immigrants #Refugees pic.twitter.com/2shDBvNYIU
