Bullshit @JacquiLambie. And to think we thought for a second you were holding out to secure their safe resettlement in NZ. The BILLIONS we have spent perpetuating these people’s suffering for 7 YEARS just to quiet some rednecks is a national shame. #medivac #LNPfail #refugees
Gutted. Fucking disgusted with Lambie. These are HUMAN BEINGS and the least you could do is explain why you think we can withhold medical care. #SaveMedevac #refugees #CloseTheCamps
Any decent person would consider it a #perversion to refer to repealing fair legislation to health care for #refugees as a 'win' ??
