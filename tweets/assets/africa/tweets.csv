"On 22 November 1996, the Tutsi Genocidaires units of the RPF Inkotanyi under Paul Kagame 's direct orders, massacred between 800 and 1000 of Hutu refugees in and around Chimanga refugee camp, seventy-one kilometers west of Bukavu."
"""Nigeria shares historical, geographical, cultural and security ties with Cameroon, and stability in the country is central to its security.""

"When they arrived at the camp, the heavily_armed Tutsi Killers encircled the Hutu refugees and coerced them to garner for a meeting. At a given moment, however, a whistle sounded and RPF Killers positioned all around the camp to open fire on the refugees."
"According to the UN Human Rights report ""Mapping Report"", a thousand of Hutu refugees were killed and more others wounded. Those who managed to run away were pursued and killed in Chimanga."
"In 1996, UNHCR estimated that there were 307,499 refugees spread over the 26 camps in the territories of Walungu, Kabare and Kalehe, commonly known as the “Bukavu camps”: Kamanyola, Izirangabo, Karabangira, Nyangezi (Mulwa), Nyantende, Muku and Mushweshwe to the south of Bukavu.."
El Commandante Retweeted Jamal
"In this context, the Mapping Team documented the following alleged incidents: On 20th Oct1996, units of AFDL/APR from Bwegera and the Rwandan town of Bugarama attacked Kamanyola refugee camp in Walungu territory,killing hundreds of refugees and Zairian civilians."
"On 21 October 1996, AFDL/APR units killed an unknown number of refugees at Nyarubale in the Kalunga hills, two kilometres from Kamanyola. Having escaped the attack on their camp at Kamanyola, the refugees were trying to reach Bukavu."
El Commandante Retweeted Jamal
"From 22 Oct1996, in the face of the advancing AFDL/APR troops, refugees from the Nyangezi and Nyantende camps began to flee towards Bukavu. From 26 October 1996 onwards, the soldiers launched attacks on the camps to the south and west of Bukavu city."

"Most cases refugees had already left camps before soldiers arrived, fleeing towards the Kashusha, INERA and ADI-Kivu camps (north of Bukavu) and the Chimanga camp towards Shabunda On 26 Oct AFDL/APR  set fire on abandoned camp of Muku, in Walungu territory."
