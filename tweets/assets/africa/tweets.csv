"South African authorities cannot say that they didn’t see this rampant violence coming. For many years refugees, asylum seekers and migrants have been targeted for who they are and what they look like. #XenophobiaInSouthAfrica"
South African authorities must come up with a security plan to ensure the safety of all refugees and migrants and seek to end these attacks once and for all. That begins with holding suspected perpetrators of past xenophobic crimes to account and breaking this cycle of impunity.
"The first major outbreak of xenophobic violence witnessed more than 11 years ago which resulted in the killing of more than 60 people, should have been a wake-up call for the authorities to root out hatred against refugees and migrants and hold those responsible to account."
"The ongoing & escalating attacks against refugees, asylum seekers and migrants, and looting of foreign owned shops in S/Africa, is a direct consequence of years of impunity & failures in the criminal justice system that have left this vulnerable group exposed and unprotected."
