It is like Dutton thinks you are all not human unfortunately. He is so cruel in every way with his task involving refugees. It is my opinion that in a thriving economy we need refugees. This govt has promoted a recession in their every action.

I reckon John Howard was worse as he had more time to do more damage and has an impressive list of achievements namely being a war criminal; was part of a triumvirate that set off an 18 year war; was a key player in demonising refugees; and encouraged ScuMo. Abbott was funnier.
