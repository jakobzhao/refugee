You destroyed Syria and you want Greece to be responsible for refugees? No.
Has any do gooder  ever given a thought to how many refugees we can take and look after them - it is is like your own house - how many guests can you keep permanently.  Govt does not have unlimited funds  to house and feed refugees permanently - subsidies to Ausies will be cut.
When that happens the do gooders will complain again - wake up you guys - priority number one - look after the Ausies first - after that if there is spare cash bring in some refugees but not at the expense of taking away from the Ausies. Look at how you use your household budget.
If we open the doors to all refugees they will come in willy nilly and we will become a third world country and start producing  our own refugees - you don’t need to be a rocket scientist to figure this out.
