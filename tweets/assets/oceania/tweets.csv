There are an estimated 11-12 million refugees in the world today - a dramatic increase since the mid-1970s when there were less than 3 million refugees worldwide.
Very fekin likely and they are not the only ones kept in cages illegally. We in Aus have a gov which thinks locking refugees up indefinitely is protecting the populous and winning them votes. Human propaganda!!!
