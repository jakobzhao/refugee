Hasn’t Dutton got a job? Like trying to find a solution to ending the detention of refugees? I sincerely hope the AFP tell him they are not interested. Since when has their job included checking the authors of books?

2. A lot of us struggle with “do we vote Labor just coz LNP has got to go or do we vote for policies we believe in?” Last year I settled for Labor for sake of quicker processing of refugees in our concentration camps.
