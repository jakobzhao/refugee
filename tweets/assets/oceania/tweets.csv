"Peter Dutton has just made stuff up to demonise refugees and scare Australians with myths about what would happen if the Medevac laws passed.

In fact, the laws, are working as planned and are simply delivering a core Australian principle – if you’re sick, you get medical care. pic.twitter.com/qSGJMfLEH6"

BREAKING: The Morrison government has secured the numbers to repeal refugee medical transfer rules and restore its border protection regime amid uproar in the Senate. http://ow.ly/VBO850xra7g 
"Oh Senator @JacquiLambie, what have you done? You (and your friends) will go down in Australian history as the people who denied sick refugees medical care. I hope that sits well with you."
The Parliament of Australia has voted this morning to repeal the Medevac legislation. And thereby they have put a nail in the coffins of who knows how many of our refugees languishing off-shore. But I suspect it may just have put a nail in the coffin of this horrible government.

The Medevac was a joke from inception.  It was always going to be open to Abuse and it was . Refugees harming themselves in order to be flown to Australia. You should just pull your head in . Not worthy of being a Senator in Australia.
Dear World .. I apologise for what our once fair country is doing to the refugees on The Manus Island and Nauru Concentration Camps ... our foul government has just repealed the Medivac Bill which allowed seriously sick refugees to be flown to the mainland For proper medical care
"why is the @smh framing repealing medevac as ""restoring the government's border protection regime""? This is not about ""border protection"" nor is it about ""national security"". This is about the government making it harder for sick refugees to get medical care. pic.twitter.com/TqKB3k9R9K"
