Has any do gooder  ever given a thought to how many refugees we can take and look after them - it is is like your own house - how many guests can you keep permanently.  Govt does not have unlimited funds  to house and feed refugees permanently - subsidies to Ausies will be cut.
When that happens the do gooders will complain again - wake up you guys - priority number one - look after the Ausies first - after that if there is spare cash bring in some refugees but not at the expense of taking away from the Ausies. Look at how you use your household budget.
