Jacqui lambie sold out refugees telling us politicians know better than doctors. We trust drs with our life I would not trust a politician with anything and that now includes lambie
About to do interview on Al Jazeera @AJEnglish about the Australian Government‚Äôs repeal of life-saving laws for the evacuation of critically ill #refugees held in offshore detention on Nauru & PNG - people who were exiled there from Australia over 6 years ago. @RefugeeLegal
Today this rotten government chose to stop refugees from receiving medical assistance. Apparently they present some kind of danger to the country. Yesterday a former PM visited a paedo in jail. Anyone else seething at the utter hypocrisy and inhumanity of those in power ?
"Three weeks before this country celebrates the birth of a refugee, it‚Äôs politicians have sentenced refugees in its care to death.

"If you‚Äôd like to show families seeking asylum that they‚Äôre welcome here, one way you can do it is to contribute to the Refugee and Asylum Toy Drive https://www.rastoydrive.org.au¬†. Even if you‚Äôre not able to donate, please check out their website and read about the work they do."
"THANK GOD we don‚Äôt have to worry about all the murderers and rapists coming into Australia through the Medevac laws! Now that the LNP has made sure those nasty refugees suffer and rot indefinitely in detention, we can all relax while our country burns. @BetootaAdvocatepic.twitter.com/cMLbdJwnEb"
"We have to understand the difference between queue jumping economic migrants and genuine refugees, and stop calling all of them refugees when all of them are not refugees."
Is there any ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù more evil than @ScottMorrisonMP ? He‚Äôs never heard of the Good Samaritan and believes that it‚Äôs your own hard luck if you were unlucky enough to be born somewhere that‚Äôs unsafe. He‚Äôs happy enough to be involved in conflicts that create refugees.

"Jacinda Ardern is telling Sky News the refugee resettlement deal remains on the table, but she hasn't had discussions with Australia in recent days. ""The ball has sat domestically with Australia for quite some time"" #auspol"
"Dear @JacquiLambie, you say you supported the repeal of Medevac because you don‚Äôt want refugees to die. Have you thought about what happens when refugees don‚Äôt get the medical attention they need? They die.  Our community is devastated & disappointed #Medevac #medevacbill"
"So the Morrison Govt will be seizing its own assets? As they are one of Australia's worst Human Rights violators! They allow refugees to die due to lack of medical attention, they turn back boats at sea... They lock up innocent families & children!"
"Racism is rife in Australian society.  If these refugees were white South Africans they‚Äôd be all living in Bondi the day after their boat ran aground. Letting these men die in pain without proper medical treatment shows how barbaric Australians have become.
