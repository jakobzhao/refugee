"Even the NY Times knows: Australia Revokes Medical Evacuations for Offshore Detainees
The government called the policy, enacted just 10 months ago, a “back door” to let refugees into the country. Human rights advocates denounced the repeal as shameful."
Yep and we can't settle about 1000 refugees....how good does that look on the world stage. For a supposed Christian @ScottMorrisonMP couldn't be further down the compassionate road that he is bordering on that fork in the road to hell
"We need to get Corruption out of our politics!

Totally ban foreign interference!

How good is running an authoritarian regime? How good is climate change? How good is that handsome chap Angus Taylor? How good is locking up refugees & not giving them suitable medical treatment? How good is when the leader of your nation is a mid level marketing manager at best?
