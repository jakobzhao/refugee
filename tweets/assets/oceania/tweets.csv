It is like Dutton thinks you are all not human unfortunately. He is so cruel in every way with his task involving refugees. It is my opinion that in a thriving economy we need refugees. This govt has promoted a recession in their every action.

I reckon John Howard was worse as he had more time to do more damage and has an impressive list of achievements namely being a war criminal; was part of a triumvirate that set off an 18 year war; was a key player in demonising refugees; and encouraged ScuMo. Abbott was funnier.

"Been watching Madam Secretary . so embarrasedtosee an episode featuring Australia as a country t hat describes itself as ""chockas"" when it comes to refugees, climate change ones in particular. SPOILER only resolved by self interest attack on tourism numbers .hangs head in shame"
"And where were they on Newstart, Adani, the Uluru Statement, refugees, metadata...

Well done Tehran bravo to Mrs Ogato. What beautiful manners and her sincerety in speaking from the Heart of The Lotus. From the blood in the river and filth suspended she rose to speak openhandedly for the maximal reach to the natural Harmony manners bring. Opening Doors TO Love!
