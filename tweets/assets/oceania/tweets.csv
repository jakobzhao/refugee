I think he meant it to be what Scott Morrison thinks of refugees. Why would we resettle refugees in regional Australia in the PM's view
He's illustrating what ScoMo thinks of refugees with his idea to resettle them in regional Australia. This is the point . The drawing is racist because of what the PM has suggested we do with refugees.He made a clear point.

It's NOT funny. Neither is the idea to resettle refugees in remote regional areas . Which is what the PM is proposing .
