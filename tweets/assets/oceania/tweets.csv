The Parliament of Australia has voted this morning to repeal the Medevac legislation. And thereby they have put a nail in the coffins of who knows how many of our refugees languishing off-shore. But I suspect it may just have put a nail in the coffin of this horrible government.

He is now well and truly beyond #ScumMo he isthe most reprehensible of the recent PMs who lacked compassion for refugees whose status may have come about partly due to our contribution to wars in their region /country
