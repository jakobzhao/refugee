Using workers as an excuse to prop up coal mining billionaires is like torturing refugees to save them from drowning.
"They were fleeing persecution and going to a ‘safer’ place to do so. Even if they were still in the same country/empire, it doesn’t negate the fact that they sought refuge from persecution - which means they were refugees."
"Anyone know if #bullshitboy #LiarFromTheShire @ScottMorrisonMP has closed Christmas Island yet? It's been a week since the Medevac Bill was repealed, and it was only opened for the influx of refugees (which didn't occur) shouldn't it be closed & the Biloela family brought back!"
"No, they don't want her to take the refugees and look like a hero.

Besides which, if we get rid of all the refugees, how will Dutton manage to get his hard on?"
