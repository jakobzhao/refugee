The people who will leave Mallacoota by naval flotilla have the distinction of being Australia's first bloc of climate refugees.
Australians (especially white Australians) are skilled at closing off our minds to troubling events nearby. Look at how we deal with our colonial past; with refugees; and how unemployed people are vilified & harassed.
