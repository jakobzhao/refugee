"The inflexible minded PM priorities...
Reopen Christmas Island to incarcerate family from Biloela 
Decimate Unions with a laughably named 'ensuring integrity bill '
Introduce a laughably named 'religious freedoms bill '
Block medical assistance to refugees ignoring doctors."
Ironically the obsession with keeping #refugees out would end if the left stopped obsessing about getting them in. It's a deliberate diversion from an #immigration programme that is mostly designed to keep labour cheap and provide lazy growth for the big end of town.
