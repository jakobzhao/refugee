The people who will leave Mallacoota by naval flotilla have the distinction of being Australia's first bloc of climate refugees.
Australians (especially white Australians) are skilled at closing off our minds to troubling events nearby. Look at how we deal with our colonial past; with refugees; and how unemployed people are vilified & harassed.
Actually Howard was warned by the UK not to take in any Africans as they had already had huge problems with them but Howard didn't listen now twice as many refugees have arrived by plane under this government than arrived by boat under Labor

This importation of violent Africans is a scam by the UN to destabilize Australian society. If we do have refugees from Africa they should be Christian.

"You've thought this, too:
