The CFA spokesperson on ABC Gippsland just referred to the evacuees across Vic as “refugees”.  That’s where we are at.

"Being round a bushfire feels like a war zone- helicopters, planes, trucks, roaring of fire, exploding trees.  Volunteers saving us. LNP Coalition meanwhile spends over a billion dollars a year keeping refugees away, as if this is the war. The money goes off-shore. Tears of anger."
"Millions, probably billions, spent on mistreating innocent refugees, come to assisting Australian refugees, nup, can’t help "

So we have climate change refugees within Australia in 2020 - Australians dying and fleeing their homes and local communities - and a PM who seems completely incapable of dealing with it.#auspol
