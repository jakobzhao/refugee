Thanks for engaging too. I only ask that we all try not to go down the route of knee jerk reactions based on this kind of click bait. All migrants and refugees deserve a fair go in the system and privacy while they go through it
These are mainly economic refugees and often young males who are seeking a better economic future. How many of these ‘refugees’ return home on tax payer dollars? You’re naive or pushing an agenda against the government. Either way you’re a fool.

I don't think Australia is a terrible place. I think we have had a government which for 20 yrs has violated human rights of refugees and it is only patriotic to fight that cruelty which has resulted in so much suffering and death; rather than going along with it like a sheep.
There are an estimated 11-12 million refugees in the world today - a dramatic increase since the mid-1970s when there were less than 3 million refugees worldwide.
Very fekin likely and they are not the only ones kept in cages illegally. We in Aus have a gov which thinks locking refugees up indefinitely is protecting the populous and winning them votes. Human propaganda!!!
