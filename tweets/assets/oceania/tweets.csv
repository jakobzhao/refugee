Morrison was delivering that speech  in front of a Christmas Tree. That's some Christmas spirit. Why is abject cruelty & sheer heartlessness a defining characteristic of Australians? What's the point of all this nastiness? #medevac #thedrum #auspol #bringthemhere #manus #refugees

The main argument from the government today was that ‚Äúthere was already a process for getting medical treatment to offshore asylum seekers‚Äù. But that system WAS NOT WORKING! That‚Äôs why 5,000 doctors want #Medevac to remain.pic.twitter.com/zdrf8m2Ss5"
More than one third of the asylum-seekers and refugees in PNG and Nauru have applied for medivac transfers to Australia. #auspolhttp://bit.ly/34JUZ4K¬†

"Oh Senator @JacquiLambie, what have you done? You (and your friends) will go down in Australian history as the people who denied sick refugees medical care. I hope that sits well with you."
The Parliament of Australia has voted this morning to repeal the Medevac legislation. And thereby they have put a nail in the coffins of who knows how many of our refugees languishing off-shore. But I suspect it may just have put a nail in the coffin of this horrible government.
