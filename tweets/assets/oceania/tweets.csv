Been embarrassed to be Australian ever since both major parties began persecuting people fleeing tyranny and turmoil with complete disregard to UN conventions we signed upto and even played a major role in formulating.  Now Aussies are climate refugees with pathetic leadership.
And that's exactly what Morrison did with refugees... he stopped the conversation... no media access to Manus and Nauru... He became emboldened enough to count on the Murdochracy to hide the deep seated corruption of this Government.
You obviously don’t know Morrison very well he let refugees be killed and tortured whats a few bears
