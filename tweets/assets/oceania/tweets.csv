"Consider.
A few years ago, Liberal supporters were howling with fury at the cost of helping out desperate refugees.
Yet now their govt's dreadful ideology and incompetence has added hundreds of millions to the costs of these fires and what do we hear from them?
Deafening silence."
"funny you say that because when the iraqis in rafha refugee camp were distributed to start this diaspora, Australia was allegedly selective to accept the educated refugees whilst the braindead were sent to Europe/North America"
"Welcome to our mean hearted, mean spirited Government. There are many in our society who have already encountered this. Centrelink recipients, all those on the Idue Card not to mention the refugees still in detention just to name a few."

He is a very cruel man. Dont overlook what he has deliberately done to refugees both as immi minister & as PM. Kept suicidal children on Nauru. Lied about it. Separated families. 3 am raids on families & others. Perpetuated #Manus #Nauru  $20 million on #Bomana to further torment
Who in Australia has heard about the refugees in the last few weeks. The left has obviously forgotten about that ball of string for the moment....

It’s heartwarming how kind everyone is to the bushfire refugees. Offering hospitality in their own home and many other acts of generosity. I wish everybody was this kind to all refugees.
My first story for 2020: a 36yo has spent the last *decade* in detention. A judge has now compared Peter Dutton's decision not to release him to the novel Catch 22. https://www.buzzfeed.com/hannahryan/tamil-refugee-australia-indefinite-detention-mental-illness …

That’s why the liberal party should be renamed “The National Front “ Dutton uses terms used by white supremacists in the US. Refugees have been given a life sentence in prison camps. The party only has Climate Change deniers in its ranks.
Hasn’t Dutton got a job? Like trying to find a solution to ending the detention of refugees? I sincerely hope the AFP tell him they are not interested. Since when has their job included checking the authors of books?

Bollocks. It's not the NZ first funding scandal that has dropped them below 5% it's the treacherous signing of the Compact on refugees. It'll take a lot more than a port in Northland to get the old drunk elected again.
