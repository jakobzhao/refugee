The Aus Gov spent Millions of $ to transfer 4 refugees to Christmas Island. Now we have Thousands of #BushfireRefugees . What will @ScottMorrisonMP & @PeterDutton_MP do ?
"Let me add further that this government has placed far more effort and money over the year  keeping potential refugees offshore, sending a single family to Christmas island, repealing medivac etc than they have given to securing population safety against climate change."

The total lack of concern or interest in destitute fire refugees in Cobargo that was on show recently gives a tiny insight into how our government has treated other refugees for 6+ years. And how they will treat any of us who might need rescue from danger.
"you cannot postpone a rendezvous with reality forever. Whatever memes the right pushes out, whatever social media strategies they adopt and propaganda they trumpet, the lesson the refugees on Australia’s beaches know too well is that fire still burns."

I am of two minds when it comes to calling people who have lost homes in fires refugees. I’ve called them refugees myself but after thinking about it I think it does take away from genuine refugees fleeing for their life. It minimises dangers that bushfire victims are not facing.
