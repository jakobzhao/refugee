A robust vetting system should exist for one reason only; to ensure the people of a country - which includes refugees - are safe from the tyrants that USE the refugee identity to gain access and harm.   Individuals suffer both sides of the fence if you can’t seperate the two.
"It's Morrison's shame if he was capable of feeling shame.
Remember, he fought for policies to let refugees die in agony in offshore prisons camps and deny them medical treatment."
