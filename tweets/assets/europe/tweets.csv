I've been writing about PTSD for almost a decade. It's not something that only comes out of military service. Omar's family fled a civil war in Somalia when she was 8 and then spent four years in a refugee camp. You should be ashamed of yourself.

What went through the minds of Tory MPs as they voted to strip child refugees and EU citizens of their rights?  Especially new ones like @VirginiaCrosbie?  I'd really like to know.pic.twitter.com/ed9JTXzKBm
"They've just voted against

protecting the right for unaccompanied child refugees to be reconciled with their family after Brexit

Erasmus

Right to pemanent residence for EU citizens settled prior to Brexit 

Ability to apeal against Settled Statis decisions

"I know the news wants to talk about Harry & Megan

But yesterday the government voted to get rid of Erasmus+, remove child refugees rights & said no to aligning with EU standards on workers rights

Don't be blinded by irrelevant Royals, the government is bulldozing the country"
Why are #R4today devoting so much time to Harry and Megan. What about the despicable votes in Parliament yesterday putting the Erasmus programme at risk and denying child refugees the right to be reunited with the family?
"Is this the kind of Britain we want to be post-Brexit? 

A country which denies refugees sanctuary and pushes vulnerable children into the hands of people smugglers? 

Boris Johnson should be ashamed, and the Tories should reverse this inhumane decision.
