Hard not to conclude there are some from the British hard-left/BDS movement who would rather see Syrian refugees dead than treated by Israelis.
You're already wrong when you use the terms 'migrants'/'immigrants' instead of 'refugees'. But you're completely mistaken if your argument pro-refugees is that 'immigration is good for the country'. It may be. It may not be. Either way I don't care. People are dying.
