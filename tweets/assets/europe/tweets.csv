The greatest solidarity is: Asking the whole world to help Iraqi asylum seekers and refugees reach the resettlement countries and to rescue them from the long suffering because of delaying the processing of their files for 3 to6 years. #StandWithIraqiRefugees
"Yes,we're the oppressed Iraqi asylum seekers&refugees,
We appealed the whole world for9months to rescue us from the long wait(3to6years of wait).

We saw a lot of migrants arrived the resettlement countries while we wait

"Today @fbunational members will travel to the refugee camps of Calais in an act of solidarity. Firefighting solidarity doesn’t recognise borders, and neither does our international solidarity with working class people who, through dire circumstance, are in a struggle for refuge. pic.twitter.com/T6oDcmllpC"

"Hundreds of Iraqi asylum seekers&refugees have waited resettlement for long years,
They have skills, talents and hard workers,
But the long waiting made them tired,
Don't kill their productivity by leaving them suffering more,
Suffering destroys creativity

"If leaving refugees suffering and waiting for long years doesn not wake the humanity to rescue them,
If a hashtag like this
#StandWithIraqiRefugees have lasted all this time with no humanitatian solution,
Then, when will humanity respond?

"We-as Iraqi asylum seekers&refugees-appreciate all the efforts that goals to rescue refugees.
But we'll be thankful to everyone who pulls us out of our suffering because of long waiting in host countries.
please rescue our future.
