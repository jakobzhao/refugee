Human rights groups should be allowed to monitor and report facts from the ground on your ongoing assault of refugees.
We have lots of poor and homeless in the US. How many more do we need?  How many immigrants/refugees should the US let in every year?  What should the population of the US be?  Is it OK to double the pop of Colorado and add 74M people to the US by 2050 through #immigration ?

Puerto Rico has been shaking for 16 days nonstop. Experts say that the probability of a larger event increased to a 12%. There’s been around 5 collateral deaths. There’s been 3 suicides. More than 600 completely damaged homes. Thousands of refugees. #EarthquakePR #TemblorPR +
The supplies that have been handed to the refugees and affected communities come from the people NOT the government. Government officials and politicians are just there for the photo op and to take credit for other people’s efforts. #EarthquakePR #TemblorPR +
