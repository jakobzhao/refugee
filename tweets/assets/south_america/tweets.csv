Why do you think Jesus was a refugee?
Yes. As he was not a refugee and did not seek refuge.
"Oh, for Heaven's sake! They were warned by God to flee because Herod wanted to kill Jesus, as he had heard that a King had been born in Bethlehem and he didn't want another king usurping his power. Egypt was part of the Roman Empire, so they weren't considered refugees."

South African refugees. Upon becoming citizens they would be designated African-Americans.
It’s clear why there’s a push for Syrian refugees...they won’t assimilate because the goal is to infiltrate and influence government (see Ilhan Omar)...and that inspires me to fight the Globalist/Soros garbage and vehemently defend my Constitutional Rights.

Hartless or heartless? Lazy entitled people like you have no idea about what refugees have gone thru. You shame this country
Forced can also mean government policies where the majority of the population disagree and get punished for resisting. Look at Europe and their refugee crisis. Look at our country with tensions between the communities thanks to race-baiters and other pimps profiting off chaos.
