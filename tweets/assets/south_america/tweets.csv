No more refugees!
"This is INSANE!  These people are refugees from what?  From there own stupid religion.  Rapes, stabbings, female mutilation, shootings, gay killings, bombings,  building of mosques are going to skyrocket in Ohio.  THESE PEOPLE DONT ASSIMILATE!"

"For all his preachiness and exploiting Christianity, @PeteButtigieg has once again shown how fake he is: REAL Christians, Pete, know that Jesus and his family were NOT ""refugees"" but traveled merely for a census, by law. They honored the law!"
"@GovHolcombIt it just shameful that Indiana's governor, Eric Holcomb, has written a letter asking for more 'refugees' to be settled here. We already have too many illegals here that we support...... Gov. Holcomb does not have Indiana citizens' best interests in mind."
"Believe me, myself being a refugee immigrant to Canada from Czechoslovakia in the 1980's, it is a big concern of mine even though I don't live there anymore. I couldn't afford to continue living there on a small pension so now I live in Ecuador."
"Sneaking over the border without a Visa and without passing through a legal entry point isn’t a legal process. Falsely claiming refugee status, as over 96% do, is also not a legal process."

Refugees build America up. MAGAts tear it down.
"The new citizenship act shows us that India needs a refugee policy in line with international law, and not a law based on discrimination and dictated by an ideology that makes use of religion for political gains۔

"3 The power of movement

Because it's NOT lost on me that the place and time I was born into afforded me the power of movement. 

The current refugee crisis is a reminder that this freedom was not one I earn but came upon by sheer luck.

"I see no problems with that because they are easily  absorbed into american culture and even improve its job markets. Absorbing muslims refugees on the other hand is much more difficult, even if they were white. It's not an ethnic thing."

"Refugee is for someone fleeing a war torn oppressive or otherwise dangerous regime. 

They are fleeing France, I know they can be a tad rude but even those garlic eating unwashed are not that bad.

The Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 gives citizenship to refugees who have had centuries of cultural affinity with Indian ethos. #IndiaSupportsCAA
The reason Israel fascinates me is that the country has no natural resources (no oil wealth unlike their neighbours) and was a barren wasteland before the Jewish refugees arrived. What they've managed to build in 70 odd years is a miracle. I want to learn and replicate in SA.
"I do not. I have the greatest sympathy for people fleeing in desperation to save their lives and believe they should be given shelter and aid. 

I do not think people fleeing France, who could settle there, then come to the U.K. on the ferry legally for a few euro, are refugees"
