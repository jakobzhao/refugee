Calling Jesus a refugee is a complete joke and idiotic! How pathetic are the people politicizing this? If you read his words he warns of this. It’s sad that msm is brining it to pass! Jesus came to us as the king of the world and our savior!

Because it's NOT lost on me that the place and time I was born into afforded me the power of movement.
