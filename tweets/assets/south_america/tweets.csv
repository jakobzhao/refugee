Everything that the United Nations touuch regarding refugees is a disaster. Take UNRWA as an example. It's a corrupt agency that keep Palestinians in poverty.

"Your are correct. 

I don't think people are put off by legitimate refugees or immigrants that follow the course laid out in our immigration laws.

What isn't acceptable are people who enter illegally, over stay tourist of other Visa's and those who file false refugee claims."
"Peru has taken in a large number of refugees from Venezuela and for a fact if they commit any crime in Peru the serve a jail term after which the are loaded up and sent back to Venezuela.

They were traveling to go back to Joseph's home town for a government census."
Not a refugee! Mary and Joseph were going back to participate in a census. Quit lying you #politician with an agenda!!!!
Must be to do with the definition. There is no war or ethnic persecution like in Burma so probably don’t count as refugees.

Why do you think Jesus was a refugee?
Yes. As he was not a refugee and did not seek refuge.
"Oh, for Heaven's sake! They were warned by God to flee because Herod wanted to kill Jesus, as he had heard that a King had been born in Bethlehem and he didn't want another king usurping his power. Egypt was part of the Roman Empire, so they weren't considered refugees."

It truly is amazing that ppl who have no relationship with Jesus or God constantly claim that Jesus was a refugee - they need to actually read the bible to find out Joseph and Mary were going home to Joseph's home town to be counted in the census and were never refugees.
