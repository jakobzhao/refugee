Who should be considered a refugee?
"Wrong, Jesus’s family fled to Egypt in the night to escape King Herod. When Joseph finally came back to Israel after Herod’s death, he chose to live in Nazareth because it was unsafe for them to be near Jerusalem. Jesus’ family were refugees."

Though during that time Egypt as well as Israel was under control of Rome. So not refugees really.
"You're a refugee if you have to flee for your life and seek safety elsewhere, even though it be within the same empire.  Should a one world government come to pass, you need not fly to the moon to be considered a refugee."

Why do you think Jesus was a refugee?
Refugees ? From France? Those #GiletJaunes protests must be god awful.
Yes. As he was not a refugee and did not seek refuge.
"Oh, for Heaven's sake! They were warned by God to flee because Herod wanted to kill Jesus, as he had heard that a King had been born in Bethlehem and he didn't want another king usurping his power. Egypt was part of the Roman Empire, so they weren't considered refugees."
"Yeah, fleeing doesn't equal refugee. Californians who flee for Texas aren't refugees either.

It truly is amazing that ppl who have no relationship with Jesus or God constantly claim that Jesus was a refugee - they need to actually read the bible to find out Joseph and Mary were going home to Joseph's home town to be counted in the census and were never refugees.

The reason Israel fascinates me is that the country has no natural resources (no oil wealth unlike their neighbours) and was a barren wasteland before the Jewish refugees arrived. What they've managed to build in 70 odd years is a miracle. I want to learn and replicate in SA.
"I do not. I have the greatest sympathy for people fleeing in desperation to save their lives and believe they should be given shelter and aid.
