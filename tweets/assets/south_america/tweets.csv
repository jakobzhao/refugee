Yes. As he was not a refugee and did not seek refuge.
"Oh, for Heaven's sake! They were warned by God to flee because Herod wanted to kill Jesus, as he had heard that a King had been born in Bethlehem and he didn't want another king usurping his power. Egypt was part of the Roman Empire, so they weren't considered refugees."

It truly is amazing that ppl who have no relationship with Jesus or God constantly claim that Jesus was a refugee - they need to actually read the bible to find out Joseph and Mary were going home to Joseph's home town to be counted in the census and were never refugees.
