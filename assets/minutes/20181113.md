### Confirming metrics of scales

- Finding common features between scales
- Using caution when mapping individuals
  - One narrative should show the experience of refugees- the life after exodus and resettlement

 

### Goals



##### Long-term:

 We will use multiple methodologies to display the data and share the stories. Continue to investigate, test, and find alternative options for visual templates. 

##### Short-term:

Following the objective line for narratives is a great start, but continue to develop the narratives based on the data available from the PIs and what we can resource otherwise. 

Start with simple web development for the landing page and overall structure and then build the complexity. 

Debug as you go, solving all small issues as they appear.
