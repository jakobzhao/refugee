1) To do: 
   Confirming metrics of scales

- Finding common features between scales
- Using caution when mapping individuals
- One narrative should show the experience of refugees- the life after exodus and resettlement

 

**Goals**



*Long-term:*

 We will use multiple methodologies to display the data and share the stories. Continue to investigate, test, and find alternative options for visual templates. 

*Short-term:*

Following the objective line for narratives is a great start, but continue to develop the narratives based on the data available from the PIs and what we can resource otherwise. 

Start with simple web development for the landing page and overall structure and then build the complexity. 

Debug as you go, solving all small issues as they appear. 



 

**Assignments:**

1) Set up appointments with PIs (Gio)

What data sources do you have?

What stories do you have?

2) IRB (Ginny)

1. 1. Individual level- still to determine level of interaction and method of survey
   2.  Visuals from established survey data
   3. 1. How , who, currently collected data? What can we visualize?
      2. Talk with refugee specialists for data

3) Git hub management (Ginny)

1. Meeting notes with entire sentences
2. Invite Jamon and Jen
3. Use the project task board 



 Task over all: Make a report throughout the project

	Document fully for easier report creation
