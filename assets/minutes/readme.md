0. Go over what we have been done during the previous week


1. Social media ads

2. Goal: What is an atlas? What should we visualize? What do we mean by visualization/making an atlas?

    - tools for refugee
    - decision-making support
    - Changing the perceptions. They are just like us.

3. a report
   - goal: viz/communition, interaction.
   - stories: themes, scales
   - tech: messege drafts, template,  react, storymap.js, webslides, mapbox.
   - papers: 
   - report:

 <h1>#20181113</h1>
1) To do: 
   Confirming metrics of scales

- Finding common features between scales
- Using caution when mapping individuals
- One narrative should show the experience of refugees- the life after exodus and resettlement

 

**Goals**



*Long-term:*

 We will use multiple methodologies to display the data and share the stories. Continue to investigate, test, and find alternative options for visual templates. 

*Short-term:*

Following the objective line for narratives is a great start, but continue to develop the narratives based on the data available from the PIs and what we can resource otherwise. 

Start with simple web development for the landing page and overall structure and then build the complexity. 

Debug as you go, solving all small issues as they appear. 



 

**Assignments:**

1) Set up appointments with PIs (Gio)

What data sources do you have?

What stories do you have?

2) IRB (Ginny)

1. 1. Individual level- still to determine level of interaction and method of survey
   2.  Visuals from established survey data
   3. 1. How , who, currently collected data? What can we visualize?
      2. Talk with refugee specialists for data

3) Git hub management (Ginny)

1. Meeting notes with entire sentences
2. Invite Jamon and Jen
3. Use the project task board 



 Task over all: Make a report throughout the project

	Document fully for easier report creation

Confirm website structure 


Confirm display of scales and narratives  

We have begun to create the website structure with the motive of helping the viewer unify the scales related to the global refugee situation. Starting with the landing page, the viewer will be shown a globe and from there will be able to see some opening information about the broad image of the situation: the definition of a refugee and much of the global locations of conflict, movement, and camp locations.  

The global data sets that we would like to include: 
	-Conflict / Push factors by location (heatmap)
	-Movement of people (flowlines from point a to point b with indicator of how many people travel this route)
	-Locations of camps/ settlement areas (hexagonal map)

From the landing page, the user may journey to view the global maps, or choose a camp or country by hovering over data points. By choosing a country, the user will trigger pop-ups of that country's refugee related data as the screen zooms into the country boundary.  By choosing a camp, the user will be presented with more camp and individual related data. We would like to make as many camps as possible into a story map format with the satellite imagery of the camp as the background. Each camp will have an illustration of camp growth over time and a narrative about the camp.  Individual/group level data stats related to the camp will also be displayed as well as a scrolling social media images related to that camp. For example, the gender ratio within the camp, the educational stats, health data, and social media images will be displayed with links for more information. 

Depending on the type and amount of data found for the camps and situations, different data visual techniques will be used. However, it is the goal of this project to continually show the data in a humanistic way as to not reduce any of the refugee experiences in a dehumanizing way. Therefore, we are actively seeking ways that may illustrate the data and narratives.

Check-in and Review structure of progress



Suggestions:

1. Start with skeleton of data	
2. Think design second
3. Create one specific story map as a template or base 


 Carousel with SM images



Data skeleton will be on Git hub: 

- Story/Case folder
  - readme.md
  - assets

Next to confirm: 

1) Threshold of camps

2) Which stories/cases to display based on available data
