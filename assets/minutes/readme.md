 <h1>#20181113</h1>
1) To do: 
   Confirming metrics of scales

- Finding common features between scales
- Using caution when mapping individuals
- One narrative should show the experience of refugees- the life after exodus and resettlement

 

**Goals**



*Long-term:*

 We will use multiple methodologies to display the data and share the stories. Continue to investigate, test, and find alternative options for visual templates. 

*Short-term:*

Following the objective line for narratives is a great start, but continue to develop the narratives based on the data available from the PIs and what we can resource otherwise. 

Start with simple web development for the landing page and overall structure and then build the complexity. 

Debug as you go, solving all small issues as they appear. 



 

**Assignments:**

1) Set up appointments with PIs (Gio)

What data sources do you have?

What stories do you have?

2) IRB (Ginny)

1. 1. Individual level- still to determine level of interaction and method of survey
   2.  Visuals from established survey data
   3. 1. How , who, currently collected data? What can we visualize?
      2. Talk with refugee specialists for data

3) Git hub management (Ginny)

1. Meeting notes with entire sentences
2. Invite Jamon and Jen
3. Use the project task board 



 Task over all: Make a report throughout the project

	Document fully for easier report creation

Confirm website structure 


Confirm display of scales and narratives  

We have begun to create the website structure with the motive of helping the viewer unify the scales related to the global refugee situation. Starting with the landing page, the viewer will be shown a globe and from there will be able to see some opening information about the broad image of the situation: the definition of a refugee and much of the global locations of conflict, movement, and camp locations.  

The global data sets that we would like to include: 
	-Conflict / Push factors by location (heatmap)
	-Movement of people (flowlines from point a to point b with indicator of how many people travel this route)
	-Locations of camps/ settlement areas (hexagonal map)

From the landing page, the user may journey to view the global maps, or choose a camp or country by hovering over data points. By choosing a country, the user will trigger pop-ups of that country's refugee related data as the screen zooms into the country boundary.  By choosing a camp, the user will be presented with more camp and individual related data. We would like to make as many camps as possible into a story map format with the satellite imagery of the camp as the background. Each camp will have an illustration of camp growth over time and a narrative about the camp.  Individual/group level data stats related to the camp will also be displayed as well as a scrolling social media images related to that camp. For example, the gender ratio within the camp, the educational stats, health data, and social media images will be displayed with links for more information. 

Depending on the type and amount of data found for the camps and situations, different data visual techniques will be used. However, it is the goal of this project to continually show the data in a humanistic way as to not reduce any of the refugee experiences in a dehumanizing way. Therefore, we are actively seeking ways that may illustrate the data and narratives.

Check-in and Review structure of progress



Suggestions:

1. Start with skeleton of data	
2. Think design second
3. Create one specific story map as a template or base 


 Carousel with SM images



Data skeleton will be on Git hub: 

- Story/Case folder
  - readme.md
  - assets

Next to confirm: 

1) Threshold of camps

2) Which stories/cases to display based on available data

The Rohingya template case is coming along with more defined structure: 


The user will begin the experience with the welcome landing page featuring an interactive globe with data points of refugee "cases". The user may access a case by clicking it's geographic location or b selecting it from a side panel of refugee case options. 



Once a case has been chosen (in this case, Rohingya), the first page will show the historical context of the refugee group. The page will scroll into a more detailed explanation of the actual "push" event. In the Rohingya case, this would be an illustration of the Mynmar military invading and committing ethnic cleansing. The user will be able to view and interact the illustration by clicking on different parts of the illustration that are linked to the interviews they illustrate. 



From this page, the user will then scroll to the "journey" page that shows the map and swoopy arrows of people movement. They will be accompanied with contextual media (photos, interviews, and narrative etc.) in a side panel. In this view, the user will either click into the camps from their geographical markers or will scroll into the camp stories. 



The camps are many, and stories are many. We decided to offer multiple stories in the form of scrolling story maps- ensuring to capture a mix of refugees (woman, man, and child). 



# Critical review with Jamon 2.25.019



Gio, Ginny, and Jamon

Overall comments: 


- Good so far but there is too much noise - cut straight to conditions and experiences
  - Focus on connecting shared experiences and shared opportunities
    
    
- Change the map theme-  not so dark

- What is our unique factor? 

- Approach this with an academic researchers perspective


  - What are the big questions that the academic community might want to find here?


1) Landing page needs some narration and context


Define refugee and Atlas purpose


Give global narrative and stats


Maybe add a Instagram feed at the global level with #refugee


define the 6ish common themes that can tie connectors between different refugee cases


> 1. Camp Infrastructure
> 2. Safety / gender based violence
> 3. Environment
> 4. Economics
> 5. Energy
> 6. Education
> 7. Health
> 8. W.A.S.H.
> 9. Food 

## Sub-topics that can be considered for themes

Future of camps (Cities of the future)

Warehousing / resettlement 

Climate hazards in camps

Further displacement after 1st camp

Births in camps

Religion

activities

Criticisms of government action

Give the user instruction to scroll 

Create icons for the themes

2) Less text more data display

let the map and the data displays do the talking

Keep the text super short- snapshots

This would be a great place to have the extra GRA help with the narrative snap shops



## Data sources to checkout: 

DAAR- refugee and war zone Architect analyst org
Kiklas Camp Turkey 
OSM query
Jamon will send papers





Terms: 
permanent temporariness

Stateless Nation



Next: 

Gio and Ginny to edit Rohingya story map with Jamon's suggestions

-Identify the Case Studies
-Identify themes

Updates to the Atlas include the discussed themes for the refugee camps. Next Steps would be to incorporate climate or other science data that offers the audience a deeper look into the situation. 

Try to create more consistency between the historical contect and the camp atlas

Get the user to the data sooner by having the mulitcoordinate view with data display be the first page with link to the historical context in the top. 





## Tasks

Reach out ot Nat Geo for media permissions

Jamon to assist in satellite imagery- Ginny and Gio to observe and learn

Bo and Gio to organize student volunteer assistance with Bo's class

If additional man power needed based on Gio's discretion, Ginny and Jamon to organize crowd sourcing tasks with Jamon's class. 





## Next Data sets 

Representing the largest refugee groups with the most available data.

Choose top 6 sites/ situations and corresponding data sets
