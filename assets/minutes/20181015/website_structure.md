##### Appearance:

- Interactive website custom built or from a bootstrap template
- Landing page followed by a first, multipartite visualization (similar to https://innovation.zeusjones.com/) that introduces to broad categories. 
- Each category will be divided in sections structured based on the content: interactive maps, geovisualization tools, storymaps, etc.

##### Content:

- Geo-narratives

  - Story map case studies: 
    - Journeys from Syria to Jordan and Turkey since 2011
    - Somali and Sudanese refugees arriving in Kenya since 1991
    - Rohingya fleeing Burma
    - Other
  - Social Media:
    - Quantitative analysis of crowdsourced social media data generated by refugees, either in camps or in asylum countries (we will combine information on the number of unique posts with available UNHCR tracking of refugee populations in order to calculate what proportion of the population of interest participates in posting)
    - Perceptions from social media data generated by refugees, either in camps or in asylum countries (capture text-based anecdotes and attitudes surrounding the refugee journey authored by refugees as well as residents and officials in a refugee-hosting country)

    - Estimate camp locations through geo-tagged tweets and Instagram photos and comparison to known locations
    - Estimate travel routes through geo-tagged tweets and Instagram photos
