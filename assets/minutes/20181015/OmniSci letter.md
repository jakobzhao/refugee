Dear ,

My name is Bo Zhao and I am Assistant Professor in Web GIS, Cartography and Geovisualization at Oregon State University. A research team formed by myself as PI and by Alix Garcia (Professor in Development Economics and Economic Geography) and Jamon Van Den Hoek (Assistant Professor in Remote Sensing) as co-PIs, has been recently awarded a grant from the National Geographic Society. The funded project will build the Global Refugee Atlas, an open, crowdsourced, and participatory online atlas that visualizes and narrates core experiences of the 65 million refugees under UN mandate.

The Atlas will be comprised of interactive story maps that convey the historical context and conditions associated with the global refugee journey. It will be innovatively constructed using crowdsourced data from social media (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, YouTube), open-access satellite remote sensing imagery on land cover or climatic conditions, and a host of readily available datasets from UNHCR and other international humanitarian agencies.

We are planning to use a Cloud Base Plan to take full advantage of your data analytics platform. We are aware of how your organization was born trying to address similar challenges, analyzing millions of tweets to determine how social media impacted the rise of the Arab Spring. As a university research group working on a non-profit, humanitarian project, we would benefit considerably from the technical support you could provide us. We are confident that our online Global Refugee Atlas will have a positive impact, helping the public develop a holistic perspective on global refugee experiences and potentially be provoked to immediate action on behalf of refugees. 

Being promoted by National Geographic at a pivotal time in global awareness and engagement with refugee issues and experiences, the Atlas has the potential to reach countless users all over the world. We would be interested in having your company as a sponsor to provide us with a free Cloud Base Plan. OmniSci will be listed as a strategic partner and as such included in the online Atlas and in the press release and other communications that will accompany the launch of the website.

If your organization would like to participate as a technical sponsor, please contact me to discuss further details. Thank you for your time and consideration.


Sincerely,
Dr. Bo Zhao
