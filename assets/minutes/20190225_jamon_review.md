# Critical review with Jamon 2.25.019

Gio, Ginny, and Jamon

Overall comments: 

- Good so far but there is too much noise - cut straight to conditions and experiences

  - Focus on connecting shared experiences and shared opportunities

    â€‹

- Change the map theme-  not so dark

- What is our unique factor? 

- Approach this with an academic researchers perspective

  - What are the big questions that the academic community might want to find here?

##### 2) Less text more data display

> let the map and the data displays do the talking
>
> Keep the text super short- snapshots
>
> This would be a great place to have the extra GRA help with the narrative snap shops
