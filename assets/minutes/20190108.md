Check-in and Review structure of progress



Suggestions:

1. Start with skeleton of data	
2. Think design second
3. Create one specific story map as a template or base 

 Carousel with SM images



Data skeleton will be on Git hub: 

- Story/Case folder
  - readme.md
  - assets

Next to confirm: 
1) Threshold of camps
2) Which stories/cases to display based on available data
