The Rohingya face widespread hostility in Myanmar, where they are perceived as illegal interlopers from Bangladesh. In 1982 the maligned minority has been stripped of citizenship and voting rights and more recently they have been denied freedom of movement, access to basic services, and are targeted by sporadic waves of violence.

The violence has been carried out by the Burmese Military and Ultranationalist Buddhist Monks.
